# Geonwork Frog TKL plate files

These plate files were handed by Geon from Geonworks -- the designer of the Frog TKL -- knowing that they would be open sourced.

The KiCAD files are of Gondolindrim's authorship. Everything is licensed under the Acheron Open-Hardware License v1.3 . Even so, please contact Geon before using them commercially.
